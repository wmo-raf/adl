# Manage Plugins

To start ingesting data from the stations, you need to configure the plugin associated with the network.

The actual configuration will depend on the plugin you have installed. Ideally, the plugin should provide a user
interface for connecting its stations and data parameters to the stations and data parameters defined in the core
application.

For plugin specific guides, refer to the plugin documentation
