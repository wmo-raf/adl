# ‚öôÔ∏è WIS2Box Automated Data Loader

Wagtail based tool for automating periodic Observation data ingestion into WIS2Box node, from Automatic and or Manual
Weather Stations.

## üìö Background

[WIS2 in a box](https://github.com/wmo-im/wis2box) (wis2box) is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) Reference Implementation
of a WMO WIS2 Node. The project provides a plug and play toolset to ingest, process, and publish weather/climate/water
data using standards-based approaches in alignment with the WIS2 principles. WIS2 in a box enables World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) members to publish and download data through the WIS2 network.

One of the critical steps in the WIS2 data flow is the ingestion of realtime data from observation stations (either
Manual or Automatic Weather Stations) into a WIS2 node. Setting up wis2box is one thing, ensuring that the data from
stations is periodically ingested into the node in a timely way is another. Countries can develop their own tools and
scripts to automate this process, but this can be time-consuming and costly especially for developing countries that
have a 'cocktail' of different AWS vendors.

One of the challenges confronting NMHSs in Africa in observation data management is the disparities between the
different station types provided by different donors. This has given rise to barriers in using the data collected by
Automated Weather Stations in a harmonized way.

These disparities include major differences in the way the data from various AWS vendors are formatted and stored, which
result in poorly coordinated, fragmented, and unharmonized datasets coming from different AWS networks.

Given the broad category of AWS vendors and types that share similar purpose of collecting weather observation data,
with different storage structure, having a monolithic application would be too large and complex to accommodate all the
possible AWS vendor types in Africa NMHSs.

One solution would be to create a core application that only knows about the high-level information of the AWS network,
and then develop small units (plugins) to handle the complexities of each AWS vendor type.

This project is an implementation of such a solution.

## üìú Introduction

WIS2Box Automated Data Loader (ADL) is a plugin based system that defines an architecture for implementing wis2box data
loaders for different AWS vendors.

The core application, which is under this repository, defines a form of contract that vendor specific plugins can extend
and provides an abstraction layer for integration of the plugins.

At a high level, this core application is made up of the following components:

- **Network component**‚Äì Table and logic with details about the AWS/Manual Stations Network. A network is a
  representation of
  a given AWS vendor type and its stations, or a collection of manual stations. When creating a network, an installed
  plugin must be associated with it to make it useful.

- **Station component** ‚Äì Table and logic with details for each station, linking to different networks, including
  defining the data parameters to be used when preparing data for ingestion into WIS2Box, and a way to load stations for
  a network, from official sources like [OSCAR Surface](https://oscar.wmo.int/surface)

- **Database** ‚Äì Postgres database where the system persists its data

- **Plugin Abstract** ‚Äì Class that defines a contract that plugins must adhere to. This is the glue that brings diverse
  types
  of AWS vendors and sources together.

- **Background tasks** for uploading data into WIS2Box node ‚Äì Each network is associated with a plugin. Since a plugin
  is standard and defines known methods of exposing its data, background tasks are created for each network that enable
  continuous checking on availability of new data and consequently the ingestion of it into a wis2box node.

On the other hand, a plugin will have the following components and features:

- **Vendor/Source specific implementation** ‚Äì Depending on the vendor type, the plugin will implement the specific
  features and logic it needs to be able to communicate with its storage on a periodic basis and determine if there is
  new data to be ingested.

- **Must adhere to the plugin contract** ‚Äì For the plugin to be useful and accepted by the core application, it must
  implement the plugin features as defined by the core application plugin contract.

- **Linking**- A plugin should provide a user interface for connecting its stations and data parameters to the stations
  and data parameters defined in the core application. At the implementation level, a plugin can add its own tables to
  the core application database if it requires to store information needed to link its stations with the stations
  defined in the core application.

### üìã Objectives

- To provide a tool for automating ingestion of data from different AWS vendors into a WIS2Box node.
- To provide a plugin architecture that allows for the development of plugins for different AWS vendors.
- To take advantage of the Wagtail CMS Admin interface to provide a user-friendly interface that facilitates easy setup
  and management of the data loaders for different AWS vendors.
- With minimal training, users at the NMHSs should be able to set up and configure an AWS vendor plugin for their
  observation data network and start ingesting data into WIS2Box node
- Provide a repository of plugins for different AWS vendors that can be shared and reused by NMHSs in Africa.

### ‚öóÔ∏è Technology Stack

- The core application is built using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework
  and [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/). Wagtail is used mainly for the Admin interface since it allows for easy
  customization and extension
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) with [Timescale db](https://www.timescale.com/) extension is used as the
  database for the system.
- [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/index.html) is used for background tasks.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) is used as the message broker for Celery.
- The system is containerized using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
- Plugins are developed as Django/Wagtail apps and integrated into wagtail
  using [Wagtail hooks](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/hooks.html).
- [Nginx](https://nginx.org) is used the static and reverse proxy server for the system.
- Bash scripts are used for installing the plugins and their dependencies at runtime.

## üß© Plugins List

The following are the plugins that have been developed and are available for integration with the WIS2Box ADL core:

- [Adcon Telemetry Plugin](https://github.com/wmo-raf/wis2box-adl-adcon-plugin)
- [Davis Instruments Weatherlink Plugin](https://github.com/wmo-raf/wis2box-adl-weatherlink-v2-plugin)

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

Before following the steps below, make sure you have the following set up:

- Docker Engine & Docker Compose Plugin : Ensure that Docker Engine is installed and running on the machine where you
  plan to execute the docker-compose command https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/. Docker Engine is the runtime
  environment for containers.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wmo-raf/wis2box-adl.git
cd wis2box-adl
```

#### 2. Setup Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and update the environment variables as needed.

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

Edit and replace variables appropriately using your text editor. Here is an example using `nano` text editor.

```sh
nano .env
```

See [environmental variables' section](#environmental-variables) below for more details on the required variables

#### 3. Create Wagtail static and media directories on the host machine and set correct permissions

Ensure you are using the correct paths as set in the `.env` file for the `WIS2BOX_ADL_STATIC_VOLUME`
and `WIS2BOX_ADL_MEDIA_VOLUME` variables.

```sh
mkdir -p ./docker/static
```

```sh
mkdir -p ./docker/media
```

##### Update the permissions for the directories

```sh
sudo chown <UID>:<GID> ./docker/static
```

```sh
sudo chown <UID>:<GID> ./docker/media
```

Replace `<UID>` and `<GID>` with the values set in the `.env` file for the `UID` and `GID` variables

#### 4. Build and Run the Docker Containers

```sh
docker-compose build
```

```sh
docker-compose up
```

To run the containers in the background, use the `-d` flag

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

#### 5. Create Superuser

```sh
docker-compose exec wis2box_adl /bin/bash
source /wis2box_adl/venv/bin/activate

manage createsuperuser
```

`manage` is a shortcut python script that is available in the container that calls Django's `manage.py`

### Environmental Variables

The following environmental variables are required to be set in the `.env` file:

A plugin must follow a given structure as described in sections below |

`Note`: On linux, you can type `id` in the terminal to get the `UID` and `GID` of the current user.

### Adding plugins

To make this tool useful, you need to add plugins that will be used to load data from different AWS vendors.

Currently, you can only install plugins that are hosted on a publicly accessible git repository.

To add a plugin, you need to set the `WIS2BOX_ADL_PLUGIN_GIT_REPOS` variable in the `.env` file to a comma-separated
list of git repositories where the plugins are located.

For example, to add the Adcon Telemetry Plugin, you will need the link to its Github repository and add it to
the `WIS2BOX_ADL_PLUGIN_GIT_REPOS` variable in the `.env` file.

```
WIS2BOX_ADL_PLUGIN_GIT_REPOS=https://github.com/wmo-raf/wis2box-adl-adcon-plugin.git
```

To add multiple plugins, separate the links with a comma.

For example to add both the Adcon Telemetry Plugin and the Davis Instruments Weatherlink Plugin, you will set the
variable as follows:

```
WIS2BOX_ADL_PLUGIN_GIT_REPOS=https://github.com/wmo-raf/wis2box-adl-adcon-plugin.git,https://github.com/wmo-raf/wis2box-adl-weatherlink-v2-plugin.git
```

Then restart the docker containers

```sh
docker-compose stop
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```

## Developing Plugins

In this guide we dive into how to create a wis2box-adl plugin, discuss the plugin architecture and give you sample
plugins to get inspiration from.

### Plugin Architecture

A Wis2box ADL Plugin is fundamentally a folder named after the plugin. The folder should be
a [Django/Wagtail App](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/applications/)

#### Initialize your plugin from the plugin boilerplate

With the plugin boilerplate you can easily create a new plugin and setup a docker development environment that installs
wis2box-adl as a dependency. This can easily be installed via cookiecutter.




#### Plugin Installation API

A built wis2box-adl docker image contains the following bash scripts that are used to install plugins. They can be used
to install a plugin into an existing wis2box-adl container at runtime. `install_plugin.sh` can be used to install a
plugin from an url, a git repo or a local folder on the filesystem.

You can find these scripts in the following locations in the built images:

1. `/wis2box_adl/plugins/install_plugin.sh`

On this repo, you can find the scripts in the `deploy/plugins` folder.

These scripts expect a wis2box-adl plugin to follow the conventions described below:

#### Plugin File Structure

The `install_plugin.sh` script expect your plugin to have a specific structure as follows:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin_name
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wis2box_adl_plugin_info.json (A simple json file containing info about your plugin)
|  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.py
|  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build.sh (Called when installing the plugin in a Dockerfile/container)
|  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ runtime_setup.sh (Called on first runtime startup of the plugin)
|  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uninstall.sh (Called when uninstalling the plugin in a container)
|  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/plugin_name/src/config/settings/settings.py (Optional Django setting file)
```

The folder contains three bash files which will be automatically called by wis2box-adl's plugin scripts during
installation and uninstallation of the plugin. You can use these scripts to perform extra build steps, installation of
packages and other docker container build steps required by your plugin.

1. `build.sh`: Called on container startup if a runtime installation is occurring.
2. `runtime_setup.sh`: Called the first time a container starts up after the plugin has been installed, useful for
   running superuser commands on the container.
3. `uninstall.sh`: Called on uninstall, the database will be available and so any backwards migrations should be run
   here.

#### The plugin info file

The `wis2box_adl_plugin_info.json` file is a json file, in your root plugin folder, containing metadata about your
plugin. It should have the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "name": "TODO",
  "version": "TODO",
  "description": "TODO",
  "author": "TODO",
  "author_url": "TODO",
  "url": "TODO",
  "license": "TODO",
  "contact": "TODO"
}
```

#### Expected plugin structure when installing from a git repository

When installing a plugin from git,the repo should contain a single plugins folder, inside which there should a single
plugin folder following the structure above and has the same name as your plugin.

By default, the `plugin boilerplate` generates a repository with this structure.

For example a conforming git repo should contain something like:

```
‚îú‚îÄ * (an outermost wrapper directory named anything is allowed but not required) 
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins/ 
‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin_name
‚îÇ  |  |  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wis2box_adl_plugin_info.json
|  |  |  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.py
|  |  |  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build.sh
|  |  |  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ runtime_setup.sh
|  |  |  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uninstall.sh
|  |  |  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/plugin_name/src/config/settings/settings.py (Optional Django setting file)
```
